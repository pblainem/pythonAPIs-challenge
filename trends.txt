1) Currently, since it's Summer in the Northern Hemisphere, we see temperatures peak north of the equator at approximately 20 degrees latitude.
2) There is little correlation between latitude and the other variables (humidity, wind speed, cloudiness)
3) When it comes to cloudiness, it tends to be all or nothing. The mode is 0% cloudy. There are fewer cities in the middle range of cloudiness (e.g. 50%)
